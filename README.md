# **Go Back End** [WIP]

This directory houses the Go back end, which is currently WIP, for the `golang-journey` project. 

It can receive requests from the front end (written in Typescript and WIP) to fetch, create, update, and delete tasks.

---

From the root directory, you can run locally:

### `go mod download`

Installs all required packages.

### `go run cmd/main.go`

Runs the main Go file to connect to a PostgreSQL database and spin up a server to listen for requests on port 8000.<br>
